# weekly-paper
  I'm a student in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, my research interest includes optimization theory, random process, machine learning and their applications on cognitive radio networks. 
  This is a blog to track my readings, mainly a motivation for myself. The update of this blog is not regular, however, initially set to a week.
